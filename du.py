'''
		-0, --null
              end each output line with NUL, not newline

       -a, --all
              write counts for all files, not just directories

       --apparent-size
              print apparent sizes, rather than disk usage; although the apparent size is usually smaller, it may be larger due to
              holes in ('sparse') files, internal fragmentation, indirect blocks, and the like

       -B, --block-size=SIZE
              scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g., '-BM' prints sizes in units of  1,048,576  bytes;  see  SIZE  format
              below

       -b, --bytes
              equivalent to '--apparent-size --block-size=1'

       -c, --total
              produce a grand total

       -D, --dereference-args
              dereference only symlinks that are listed on the command line

       -d, --max-depth=N
              print  the  total for a directory (or file, with --all) only if it is N or fewer levels below the command line argu‚Äê
              ment;  --max-depth=0 is the same as --summarize

       --files0-from=F
              summarize disk usage of the NUL-terminated file names specified in file F; if F is -, then read names from  standard
              input

       -H     equivalent to --dereference-args (-D)

       -h, --human-readable
              print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)

       --inodes
              list inode usage information instead of block usage

       -k     like --block-size=1K

       -L, --dereference
              dereference all symbolic links

       -l, --count-links
              count sizes many times if hard linked

       -m     like --block-size=1M

       -P, --no-dereference
              don't follow any symbolic links (this is the default)

       -S, --separate-dirs
              for directories do not include size of subdirectories

       --si   like -h, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

       -s, --summarize
              display only a total for each argument

       -t, --threshold=SIZE
              exclude entries smaller than SIZE if positive, or entries greater than SIZE if negative

       --time show time of the last modification of any file in the directory, or any of its subdirectories

       --time=WORD
              show time as WORD instead of modification time: atime, access, use, ctime or status

       --time-style=STYLE
              show times using STYLE, which can be: full-iso, long-iso, iso, or +FORMAT; FORMAT is interpreted like in 'date'

       -X, --exclude-from=FILE
              exclude files that match any pattern in FILE

       --exclude=PATTERN
              exclude files that match PATTERN

       -x, --one-file-system
              skip directories on different file systems
